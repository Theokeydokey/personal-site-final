# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

This React-based personal webpage serves as a professional showcase of my skills as both a web developer and a content creator. Designed with clarity and functionality in mind, the site provides visitors—particularly instructors and evaluators—with an interactive overview of my technical abilities, creative projects, and digital presence.

Built using ReactJS and react-router-dom for smooth navigation, the application integrates the Twitch Clip API to dynamically display highlights from my content creation work. This project reflects my passion for both coding and media production, and demonstrates how I can merge these two worlds through modern web technologies.
